                <h3>PINAKBET</h3>
                <p>Pinakbet may be a beloved dish all over the Philippines, but not everyone knows that it’s a product of the Ilokanos. This vegetable stew is made of eggplant, okra, bitter gourd, garlic, onions, string beans, winged beans, and tomatoes as its base ingredients. Unlike other versions, the Ilokano pinakbet does not include squash as locals believe that it distorts the aroma and taste of the other vegetables.</p>

                <h3>EMPANADA</h3>
                <p>Another well-loved product of Ilocos is its version of an empanada. The popular street food originated in Batac, Ilocos Norte, and is now a favorite snack even in Manila. What sets Ilocos Empanada apart from the rest is its color and ingredients! Ilokanos use annatto seeds to add color to its dough, making it vibrantly orange. Inside, you’ll typically find chopped Vigan longganisa, green papaya, mung beans, and an egg. It is then deep-fried to perfection and best devoured as soon as it leaves the pan.</p>

                <h3>BAGNET</h3>
                <p>Bagnet, known locally in Ilocos as chicharon, is a deep-fried pork dish known for its crunchy skin and a golden-brown color. Although it’s similar to lechon kawali, Ilokanos prepare bagnet differently to make it uniquely their own. They first boil a slab of pork, then air-dry it for a couple of hours before deep-frying it multiple times to achieve its crispy state. Albeit a tedious process, this is what makes bagnet one of the best food in Ilocos - and in the entire country.</p>

                <p>A list of the best food to try in Ilocos will not be complete without the inclusion of Vigan Longganisa. This plump sausage originated from, typically bite-sized but packed with garlicky flavor. For breakfast lovers, it’s often paired with silog, or a combination of fried egg and fried rice, with a spicy sukang iloko (vinegar native in Ilocos) on the side.</p>

                <h3>DODOL</h3>
                <p>For fans of sweet treats, Ilocos’s dudol will appease your sweet tooth cravings. This well-loved Ilokano snack came from the Malay and Indian settlers who lived in the coastal towns of Ilocos, even before the arrival of the Spaniards. It’s a mix of rice flour, coconut milk, and sugarcane juice, cooked continuously under slow fire. This process is what makes it thick yet sticky and incredibly delicious.</p>

Tupig is composed of glutinous rice cake with grated coconuts and molasses wrapped in banana leaves. It’s cooked over a charcoal fire, giving the final product both an aromatic and smoky hint to it.</p>
