        <p>
            Laoag is the capital city of Ilocos Norte, which boasts of a charming blend of small-town traditional culture and a dynamic, modern lifestyle. It also features a mix of a rich Spanish influence, marked by beautifully preserved ancestral houses, colonial architecture buildings, and century-old churches, and an Ilocano heritage that is mostly evident in its local customs and delectable cuisine.
            The word laoag means “light” in the native language spoken in the region, earning the town its titles of being the “The Sunshine City” and “City of Lights” in the country. The city also enjoys a tropical savanna climate with mostly sunny days and warm temperatures all year round.
            Both the official languages of the country, namely Filipino and English, are widely understood and spoken here, so communication, especially for international travelers won’t be a problem. However, the town’s local language is Ilocano, and it will be useful to learn some basic phrases and words of the language to capture the hearts of the locals.
            Aside from incredible sights and historical landmarks, Laoag is also jam packed with attractions and activities that will satisfy every kind of traveler. From breathtaking scenery complemented with a laid-back ambience, to nearby seascapes and surf towns, down to adventure excursions on its rugged and mountainous terrains, The Sunshine City is truly nothing short of a brilliant destination that puts the Ilocandia region in the spotlight.
